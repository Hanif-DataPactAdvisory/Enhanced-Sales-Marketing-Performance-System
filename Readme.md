# Enhanced Sales & Marketing Performance System

This portfolio project demonstrates a complete, automated data pipeline built in Python. It simulates a real-world business process by ingesting, cleaning, and reconciling data from four separate business systems (CRM, Finance, Marketing, Ad Platforms) to generate high-value, actionable reports on sales commissions, marketing ROI, and lead quality.

This script is the "engine" for a high-value service, replacing thousands of hours of manual, error-prone spreadsheet work.

## üöÄ The Business Problem ("Papercut Pains")

This project directly solves several acute, high-frustration "papercut pains" for businesses:

* **The Manual Report Factory :** Marketing and sales teams struggle to connect disparate data. This script automates the generation of complex performance reports, saving hours of manual data pulling.
* **The Spreadsheet Maze :** Calculating commissions is often a "VLOOKUP hell" of complex, brittle spreadsheets. This script replaces that with robust, maintainable Python logic.
* **The Data Janitor :** Data is never clean. This project performs essential data cleaning and reconciliation, like extracting Opportunity IDs from messy finance descriptions.
* **The CRM Sinkhole  / Ad Spend Waste :** It's hard to prove value. This script links ad spend to actual CRM deals and calculates true ROAS, demonstrating mastery of sales/marketing data.
* **Bookkeeping Black Hole :** It applies complex financial rules (commissions, tiers, clawbacks) automatically, reducing errors and saving time.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Solution: An Automated Analysis Engine

This Python script ingests four mock CSV files:
1.  **`crm_closed_deals.csv`** (Simulating a Salesforce export)
2.  **`finance_payments.csv`** (Simulating a Stripe/QuickBooks export)
3.  **`marketing_touches.csv`** (Simulating a HubSpot/Marketo export)
4.  **`ad_spend.csv`** (Simulating a Google/Facebook Ads export)

It then automatically performs:
* **Data Cleaning:** Converts data types, handles missing values, and standardizes data.
* **Financial Reconciliation:** Intelligently merges finance payments with CRM deals using extracted IDs.
* **Commission Calculation:** Applies complex, multi-tiered commission rules, including product modifiers and refund clawbacks.
* **Marketing ROI Analysis:** Attributes ad spend to closed deals to calculate real-time ROAS and CPA.
* **Lead Scoring:** Implements a rule-based engine to score leads based on high-intent marketing actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è The "Before & After" (The Final Reports)

The script transforms raw, disconnected data into three powerful, clean reports:

### 1. Final Commission Report

(This report calculates final pay for each rep, per quarter, after applying all business logic.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Setup

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas:** For core data manipulation and analysis.
* **Faker:** Used by `generate_data.py` to create mock data.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For generating report visualizations.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Install required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas faker matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  Run the mock data generator (only needs to be run once):
    ```sh
    python generate_data.py
    ```
4.  Run the main analysis script:
    ```sh
    python commission_analyzer.py
    ```
5.  Check the `reports/` folder for the saved CSV and PNG (chart) files.
